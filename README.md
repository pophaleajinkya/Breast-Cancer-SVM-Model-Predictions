# Breast-Cancer-SVM-Model-Predictions

Overview

The problem our code is trying to solve is classifying lumps in a patientâ€™s breast as benign or cancerous. Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and one of the most important health issues of the modern age. If our model can accurately identify benign and malignant cancer cells, we can allow patients to receive the treatment they need in order to fight breast cancer without wasting precious time. The success of this model can also cause cost reduction for Hospitals by optimizing treatment quickly, saving both costs and lives. This code specifically walks through data preparation, model training, and evaluation steps using machine learning techniques in Python.
